# cbar

This R package focuses on tools for detecting anomaly on a time series, using
Bayesian contextual anomaly detection.

cbar uses [bsts](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bsts/index.html), so
it is highly influenced by [CausalImpact](https://github.com/google/CausalImpact)
for understanding, but the goal is different.
